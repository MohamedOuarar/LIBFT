# LIBFT

Libft is a project that requires you to create a library of useful functions that you can use in future projects at 1337. In this project, you will create a library of functions that replicate some of the standard functions in the C library, as well as some additional functions that you may find useful.

# Installation:

To use this library, you must first compile it into a static library file. To do this, run the following command:

`make`

This will compile the library into a file called libft.a.

# Usage :

To use the functions in this library, you must include the libft.h header file in your source code:

`#include "libft.h"`

You can then call any of the functions in the library in your code.

# Functions:

The library contains several functions that you may find useful in your future projects, including:

- ft_memset: Sets a block of memory to a specific value.
- ft_bzero: Sets a block of memory to zero.
- ft_memcpy: Copies a block of memory from one location to another.
- ft_memccpy: Copies a block of memory from one location to another, stopping if a certain character is found.
- ft_memmove: Copies a block of memory from one location to another, handling overlapping blocks correctly.
- ft_memchr: Searches a block of memory for a specific character.
- ft_memcmp: Compares two blocks of memory.
- ft_strlen: Calculates the length of a string.
- ft_strlcpy: Copies a string to a specified buffer, ensuring that the destination buffer is not overflowed.
- ft_strlcat: Appends a string to a specified buffer, ensuring that the destination buffer is not overflowed.
- ft_strchr: Searches a string for a specific character.
- ft_strrchr: Searches a string for a specific character, starting from the end of the string.
- ft_strnstr: Searches a string for a specific substring.
- ft_strncmp: Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.
- ft_atoi: Converts a string to an integer.
- ft_isalpha: Determines whether a character is an alphabetic character.
- ft_isdigit: Determines whether a character is a digit.
- ft_isalnum: Determines whether a character is an alphabetic character or a digit.
- ft_isascii: Determines whether a character is an ASCII character.
- ft_isprint: Determines whether a character is printable.
- ft_toupper: Converts a lowercase character to uppercase.
- ft_tolower: Converts an uppercase character to lowercase.
- ft_strdup: Duplicates a string.
In addition to these functions, the library also contains some additional functions that you may find useful, such as functions for working with linked lists.

# Conclusion:

The Libft project is an important project that will help you to build a library of useful functions that you can use in future projects. By completing this project, you will gain a better understanding of how to write C functions and how to work with memory in C.
